        <h2>How to churros this?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). 
                <br>Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; 
                <br>stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, 
                <br>about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. 
                <br>Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</li>
            <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. 
                <br>Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. 
                <br>Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; 
                <br>roll churros in the mixture while still hot.
            </li>

        </ol>
